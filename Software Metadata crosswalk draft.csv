Purpose of schema,,,,"""Emulation-centric preservation, starting at the ingest stage with media transfer and metadata capture, continuing through file characterization and emulation pathway identification and finishing with the automatic configuration of emulated environments through which end users may have access to preserved digital objects.""
","""support the preservation of digital objects and ensure their longterm usability""--designed to manage software in relationship to other digital files","online registry of technical information.  Designed to record information about fileformats, software products, and other technical components required to support long-term access to digital objects.","RDF schema and xml vocabulary to describe software projects, especially free and open source software","Community project to create a minimal metadata schema for science software and code.  Goal to create a concept vocabulary that can be used to standarize the exchange of software metadata across repositories and organizations.  Designed for code reuse and citation (not preservation, specifically).  Crosswalk used to develop schema can be found here:  https://github.com/codemeta/codemeta/blob/master/crosswalk.csv  Lots of uptake in the community--from Mozilla.org to Figshare. ","Structured data for web pages, primarially for discovery and SEO purposes",,"The acronym SEON stands for Software Evolution ONtologies and represents our attempt to formally describe knowledge from the domain of software evolution analysis and mining software repositories. SEON consists of multiple ontologies, for example to describe stakeholders, activities, artifacts, and the relations among all of them. The ultimate goal is to facilitate the implementation of tools that help software engineers to manage software systems over their entire life-cycle.","This site/project is an ecnyclopedic listing of formats; software, metadat schemas, etc. It doesn't crosswalk nor lend itself to this project.","Collect, preserve, and make accessible source code for the benefits of present and future generations.  Publically available source code only from GitHub, Debian, GNU project; planning to crosswalk to CodeMeta for preservation purposes",Cross-domain knowledgebase of strucuted data,name of the property used in Wikidata,The National Software Reference Library (NSRL) is designed to collect software from various sources and incorporate file profiles computed from this software into a Reference Data Set (RDS) of information. ,Ontologies for cataloging and describing digital games as well as a citation system for these objects.,Standards for the representation and communication of bibliographic and related information; primarialy for discovery,Descriptive metadata designed to facilitate interoperability,Schema for a bibliographic element set; primarialy for discovery,Library of Congress statement with best practices for capturing physical and technical characteristics of software that maximizes the chances for survival and continued accessibility of the content.,Knowledge base of file format information for digital preservation; designed to unify the function and holdings of PRONOM and GDFR,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
