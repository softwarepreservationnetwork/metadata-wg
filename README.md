# Metadata Working Group
This repository contains files created by the Metadata Working Group of the Software Preservation Network.

The [Software Preservation Network](http://www.softwarepreservationnetwork.org/) (SPN) coordinates software preservation efforts to ensure the long term access to software. The Metadata Working Group is responsible for developing, promoting, and advocating for common metadata frameworks and related metadata standards, vocabularies, and ontologies that support software preservation and access. Other documentation from SPN and the MGW can be found in our [OSF repository](https://osf.io/a7uea/).

## Software Preservation Standards Crosswalk
An initial project of the SPN MWG has been to develop a crosswalk of metadata standards as they pertain to describing and preserving software. The crosswalk is organized by the use of the "semantic unit," which refers to the core piece of information being recorded rather than how the information is stored.  Each semantic unit is crosswalked to other metadata schemas identified by the MWG.  These schemas include national standards such as MARC, Dublin Core, and PREMIS, as well as metadata initiatives such as the [ CodeMeta Project](https://codemeta.github.io/).

This crosswalk is currently an early draft and is in the process of being revised. It has been published here to generate revisions and comments.  Please send us a pull request if you have any updates!
